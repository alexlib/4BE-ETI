Code for three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry with an enhanced initialization

## Installation

To use this code, python 3 has to be installed on your computer. An easy way to install python on most machines is to use anaconda. More information can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Please note that if you install miniconda, you will need to also install the different python packages needed to run the code. 

If you have any questions about setting up and installing python, feel free to email clarka34 at uw dot edu.

## Usage
There are three python files in this github repository. The user only needs to update one file: **particle_tracking.py**

Once this file is updated, the code can be run in the terminal:
```python
python particle_tracking.py
```

## Example Files
Some example particle data files have been included in the Examples folder along with a jupyter notebook entitled **example_setup.ipynb**. This example notebook shows you examples of how to run the code, plot trajectories found using the code, and calculate velocities and accelerations.

To open this jupyter notebook:
```python
jupyter notebook example_setup.ipynb
```
